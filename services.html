  				<p>The office moved in 2009 from the Benewah Community Hospital to its current location.  Many upgrades were made to make the patient experience more efficient and comfortable.</p><br>

				<p>Digital X-Ray:<em>  The practice converted to digital x-ray.  We have the capabilities to expose intra-oral and extra-oral radiographs.  The digital sensor is very sensitive and only requires 20% of the radiation when compared to a traditional x-ray.</em></p><br>

				<p>Sterilization:<em>  There are two sterilizers at the office which use high pressure and steam to efficiently clean the instruments.  Regular tests are done to ensure proper function.</em></p><br>

				<p>Treatment Rooms:<em>  The office has four treatment rooms.  Two rooms are dedicated to hygiene appointments.  The remaining two rooms are used for dental treatment.  Each room is equipped with an intra-oral digital x-ray, personal music if desired, and a beautiful view of the mountains surrounding St. Maries.</em></p><br>

				<p>Financial Policy:<em>  We are preferred providers for Delta Dental, Blue Cross of Idaho, Blue Shield and Cigna.  We bill most insurance companies for your convenience.  Additional payment options include cash, check, visa, mastercard and Care Credit.</em></p>
